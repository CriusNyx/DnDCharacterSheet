Saving And Loading Pattern

Create a file in the db called index (and also some way to regenerate 
index if it gets damaged)
Index contains a list of known characters, and mappings to their files

The user selects a character from the index file.
If the user decides to, a list of revisions of that character
can be selected, or the latest revision can be loaded

index file is managed by the backend. No front end management of index


Make save / open button on pannel at top
Make it auto save when opening a new character.
